# TamlynScore

This project is a rewrite of
[archery-scoring](https://www.github.com/mjtamlyn/archery-scoring). It can be
considered a version 2 of that project, rewritten to be more flexible, more
reusable, and more powerful. It will also have a much more performant and
interactive front end with a backing API, allowing development of companion
applications.
